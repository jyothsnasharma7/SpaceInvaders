# SpaceInvaders

🚀 AI-Based Space Invaders
A Python + Pygame remake of the classic Space Invaders, featuring a fully autonomous AI player.
The agent uses state-space search, heuristics, and rule-based logic to move, dodge bullets, and shoot intelligently.
Demonstrates real-time decision-making based on game state (player, aliens, bullets, threats).
Built as part of an Artificial Intelligence course project.
